# Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning
**Project Overview**
This repository hosts machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models designed to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. Leveraging a dataset sourced from Kaggle, specifically the Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset provided by the Machine Learning Group at ULB (Universit√© Libre de Bruxelles), this project is crucial for the development and testing of advanced models for fraud detection in credit card transactions.

**Models**
The repository encompasses both traditional machine learning models and advanced deep learning models. These models undergo rigorous training and evaluation processes to ensure optimal performance in distinguishing between legitimate and fraudulent credit card transactions. The inclusion of various models allows for comparative analysis and selection of the most effective solution.

**Dataset Description**
The dataset serves as a foundation for training and evaluating the effectiveness of the machine learning and deep learning models. It includes a diverse range of credit card transactions, with a subset intentionally designed to represent fraudulent activities. This dataset, being a product of ULB's Machine Learning Group, offers a robust benchmark for testing the models' capabilities in identifying and mitigating credit card fraud.

**Files**
